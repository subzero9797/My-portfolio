     -it's been a long time 5 years in a new place went your home some day.
     -the begining was like being alone in a big city no where to go !! .
     -thennn you met your first colleague and you don't know that he will be your friend to the last day.
     -projects homeworks new scince it's like every where just catch it if you can. 
     -you think it wont be over till you die (-_-) . 
     -my first & second year was the best to have fun.
     -the third one became realy pain in the ass. 
     -buuut i will never surrender lol.
     -the train will never stop also me till the next station.

     -also at third my friends became closer to me not changable at all.
     -in the middle of this chaeos the days run to the fourth year 
      then in the second semester i volunteered at sarc which i will talk about in another section.
     -to be honest between these days i've played video games (online-local) after & before exams with my friends 
      playing was part of the college as u know (-_^).

     -the 5th year i think something changed or i've changed it was ending of a journey u thought it wont pass
      I turned into a quiet person who will listen and wont talk alot, the work changed me or the days 
      I dont know but realy something changed. 
     -every single one want to travel or run from our war.
     -returning to now only one friend is near the rest with their wings are outside syria
     -this was a short story of college era withot mentioning alot .

-AS i've mentioned before at my 4th college year i became a sarc volunteer .
-firstly it was a huge challenge to work and study and make balance between sarc and college.
-as many students a wanted money like any person on this planet earth.
 then after a while sarc became part of me after graduation i went to work literally every single day.


-some of them became my family we shared food drink having breakfast in spare times,
 working in a team lerned me that acomplishing missions need a lot of hands not only one could clap.
-helping people by determine what they need & distributing food-Nonfood items was part of my team work.
-ALL of that was happening as a volunteer in AL-hamdaniyah relief team.


- 2 years later i've participated in (vnr) project as an assistant field officer leading 4 males & 4 females
-The target of the project was doing alot of A questionnairies to the beneficiaries in Aleppo city 
 including the countryside ,Providing team members with training, feedback, and coaching
 was part of my job including daily reports.
-To the end of vnr project i prepared my self to getback to my old team or  
 finding another job related to my field of study.


-Then someone asked me to be a Relief team leader, to be honest i was confused about accepting the position,
 they encoraged me i said yes , 7 monthes was a big deal to me ,
-i've enjoyed each day learning what a leadership is, u have to be fair to each volunteer , 
 giving them instructions, Take decisions related to the safety of volunteers and determine their daily tasks,
 preparing distribution plans , All of that would be a heavy burden without everyone's help.
-My team became my friends we've built the center block by block
 cause it was a new team and we were the first to launch it.


         
-After 7 months of hard working i resigned no words to say just my mission is over,
 thanks all, my best wishes i'm done.
-I wanted to work as a civil engineer for that i'm trying to play that role now,
-having my own website is a hobby i wanted to have some day and i'm doing it right now,
 using (html-css) which i've learnt recently.

    -"Friends" we need to define that word nowadays.


    -As many people i do have freinds in college-work-neighborhood,
    -normal places to meet normal people thats what i did.

    -closest to my heart are who i spent a lot of time with,
    toufic bibers hussein hussam mustafa and the smartass noooura are part of my memories.


    -Backing to work friends are alot but some are in my heart others outside for sure.

    -No words to be said more but i wanna say that having one or two true friends in life
     would be enough in circle of friendships. 
    -the photos here can describe many feelings to my freinds.
    -sorry i didn't find hamdaniyah breakfast pics (^_-).

        -MY sections above may have abbreviated my career especially sarc section.
        -but as a summarization i was a normal 5 years /student >>Civil Engineer/ (2015-2020),
         sarc (Volunteer >>Field officer >>Team leader) for about three years & 7 months (2019-2022) 

        -many difficult times during war and studying period,both financial or psychological.
        -none of that was easy but only by god hands the things was running.
        -every one has dreams, i think making life easier to live is every engineer dream, 
         regardless the way of achieving it.

        -learning (html-css) is now one of my hobbies thinking next in java script,
         and for that purpose i launched my own website. 
         thanks All for spending time reading my blog.


         -I will always update my blog hope you've enjoyed it,
          sincerely Ahmad.
